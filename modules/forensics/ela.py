"""
Error Level Analysis (ELA) - JPEG Compression Forensics.

Detects regions of a document image that have a different JPEG compression
history than the surrounding image. This acts as evidence of digital splicing or editing.

Theory:
  JPEG compression is lossy via DCT quantization. Recompressing an image at
  a fixed quality Q produces near-zero pixel differences in regions already
  at quality Q. It produces elevated differences in regions edited or saved at a
  different quality. Examples include a spliced photo or modified text block.

Three modes:
  1. full_document  - whole image ELA (detects large-scale edits)
  2. region         - ELA restricted to a supplied bounding box (photo/QR/stamp)
  3. heatmap        - returns amplified RGB difference array for visualization
